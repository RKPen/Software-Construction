Enqueue Method:
   - Test with an empty queue by enqueuing a single element and then checking if it's the front.
   - Test by enqueuing multiple elements and ensure they are in the expected order.
   - Check the size of the queue after enqueuing to verify it increases.
   - Add an assert statement to check if the size of the queue increases by one after enqueuing an element. 
    
Dequeue Method:
   - Test with an empty queue to ensure it doesn't throw errors.
   - Test by enqueuing elements and then dequeuing them one by one while verifying the size decreases.
   - Test by enqueuing and dequeuing elements in various orders and ensure the front is correct.
   - Add an assert statement to verify that dequeuing an element from a non-empty queue results in the expected size decrease.
    
Front Method:
   - Test with an empty queue to ensure it doesn't throw errors.
   - Test with a non-empty queue to ensure it returns the correct front element.

IsEmpty Method:
   - Test with an empty queue to confirm it returns true.
   - Test with a non-empty queue to confirm it returns false.

Size Method:
   - Test with an empty queue to verify it returns 0.
   - Test with a non-empty queue to verify it returns the correct size after enqueuing and dequeuing elements.

Clear Method:
   - Test with an empty queue to ensure it doesn't throw errors.
   - Test with a non-empty queue, call Clear, and then verify the size becomes 0.
